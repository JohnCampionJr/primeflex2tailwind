### WindiCSS PrimeFlex Converter

* UI code borrowed from [WindiCSS Docs](https://github.com/windicss/docs)

* Converts [PrimeFlex](https://www.primefaces.org/primeflex/) code into Tailwind / WindiCSS.

* Some tweaks in tailwind/windi.conf.ts

* Remaining missing classes are in SCSS files in /src/styles/primeflex-tailwind

Built this because I wanted the full toolset available with Tailwind / WindiCSS but I use PrimeVue and PrimeBlocks in multiple projects.

This lets me use PrimeFlex code in the Tailwind environment with no problems.
